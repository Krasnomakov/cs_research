# Adaptive Covert Electromagnetic Transmission

This repository contains the source code for the offensive-side implementation of the Adaptive Covert Electromagnetic Transmission (ACET) project. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of transmitting data over an air-gap through electromagnetic emissions generated by controlled CPU load modulation. This minimal viable prototype (MVP) is inspired by the ODINI covert channel and serves as the foundation for future advancements in modulation techniques, stealth improvements, and adaptive detection.

## Overview

- **Transmitter (Offensive Side)**
  - **Language:** C  
    Implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4, the transmitter modulates the CPU load using multi-threading to generate electromagnetic emissions corresponding to a hardcoded bitstream.
  - **Modulation Technique:** On-Off Keying (OOK) by toggling CPU activity (active for bit '1', idle for bit '0').
  - **Frequency Range:** Approximately 200â€“310 MHz.

- **Receiver (Defensive Side)**
  - **Language:** Python  
    The receiver leverages Software Defined Radio (SDR) tools (such as GQRX with TCP/IP interface) to capture EM emissions. It decodes the transmitted bits by comparing live signal power levels.
  - **Communication:** Connects to GQRX via Telnet commands to retrieve and process the signal data.

## Files

- `cpu_transmitter.c`  
  C source code for the transmitter. Contains:
  - Main loop sending a predefined bitstream (e.g., "10101").
  - CPU load modulation using multi-threaded routines via `pthread`.
  - Timing control using high-resolution sleep functions (e.g., `usleep`, `clock_gettime`).

- `gqrx_tcp_ip_listener.py`  
  Python script for the receiver that connects to GQRX over TCP/IP, polls the signal level using the `l` command, and processes the results to detect and decode bit transitions.

- `sender.py` (if applicable)  
  An alternative or experimental transmitter implementation in Python for prototyping purposes.

- `receiver.py` (if applicable)  
  An additional Python script demonstrating signal decoding and logging.

- `sweeps.csv`  
  Sample data file used for logging or analysis purposes.

- `README.md`  
  This file provides an overview and instructions for both transmitter and receiver setups.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- **Transmitter:** Raspberry Pi 4 (recommended 4GB model)
- **Receiver:** SDR device (e.g., HackRF One or RTL-SDR) with the appropriate antennas

### Software

- **For the Transmitter (C code):**
  - GCC compiler with pthread support  
    Compile using:
    ```bash
    gcc -O2 -pthread cpu_transmitter.c -o cpu_transmitter
    ```
- **For the Receiver (Python scripts):**
  - Python 3.x
  - Required packages: `numpy`, `pandas`  
    Install using:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas
    ```

## How to Use

### Transmitter Setup

1. **Compile the C Code:**
    ```bash
    gcc -O2 -pthread cpu_transmitter.c -o cpu_transmitter
    ```
2. **Run the Transmitter:**
    ```bash
    ./cpu_transmitter
    ```
    The transmitter repeatedly sends the hardcoded bitstream while modulating the CPU load to generate EM emissions.

### Receiver Setup

1. **Start GQRX** with TCP/IP control enabled.
2. **Run the Python Listener Script:**
    ```bash
    python gqrx_tcp_ip_listener.py
    ```
    The receiver connects to GQRX, retrieves the signal level using the `l` command, and logs detected bit transitions.

## Future Development

The current MVP lays the groundwork for future enhancements, which include:
- Experimenting with different modulation schemes (e.g., FSK, OFDM) and modifying transmission parameters (frequency, duty cycle)
- Improving stealth capabilities to better evade detection
- Enhancing range and signal robustness through hardware upgrades and algorithmic improvements
- Developing adaptive detection strategies for the defensive side
